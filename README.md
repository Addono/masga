# MaSGA - Make Sauna Great Again [Front-end]
Winner of the Junction 2018 challenge "Hack the Sauna" by Vaisala

This is the code for the front-end, the back-end code can be found in [Addono/masga-backend](https://github.com/Addono/masga-backend).

A live version can be found [here](https://aknapen.nl/masga).

## Deployment
The front-end is just a static HTML website which retrieves and displays the data from the back-end. Deploy the code by making it accessible like one would do for any static HTML website, e.g. by using Github Pages.
